LOCAL INK!

The Local Ink application was created to be a solution to a problem that many people encounter when they look for local  tattoo arts or artists. We want to connect the correct artists to clients within their local vecinities. The Local Ink app can be used in two seperate manners. 

AS THE ARTIST:

As an artist, you will come to Local Ink and create an online portfolio where potential clients can view you, your work, recommendations, and contact information. Advertise yourself to the potential clients you are searching for. 

AS THE CLIENT:

As the client you can come to Local Ink and narrow down your search for a great artist in your neighborhood without having to go out to many different locations searching for one particular person or theme. We know you dont have a lot of time to be going to every artists shop and looking through portfolios only to find that they cannot create what you desire.
