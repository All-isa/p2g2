APP TITLE HERE:

This application was created to be a solution to a problem that many people encounter when they look for local arts or artists. We want to connect the correct artists to clients within their local vecinities. Our app can be used in two seperate manners. 

AS THE ARTIST:

As an artist, you will come to our site and create an online portfolio where potential clients can view you, your work, your recommendations, and where to find you. Advertise yourself to the potential clients you are searching for. 

AS THE CLIENT:

As the client you can come to our site and narrow down your search for a good artist in your local area without having to go out to many different locations searching for one particular person or theme. We know you dont have a lot of time to be going to every artists shop and looking through portfolios only to find that they cannot create what you desire.
